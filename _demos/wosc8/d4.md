High-performance applications are predominantly implemented on top of
fast and low-level frameworks such as the Message-Passing Interface
(MPI). However, existing systems are based on static and long-running
batch allocations, leading to resource underutilization in both
scientific clusters and cloud systems. HPC users would benefit from
using more elastic resource provisioning and cheap on-spot cloud
resources, but they cannot sacrifice performance guarantees of
persistent allocations. Serverless functions could provide the
flexibility needed for the dynamic offloading of computations, but
their performance does not match the HPC performance requirements. To
that end, we propose rFaaS, an improved serverless architecture with a
new allocation type and invocation protocol that incorporates Remote
Direct Memory Access (RDMA) networking. Fine-grained functions can
scale up quickly and without prior resource allocation, helping
parallel applications to optimize resource consumption while not
suffering from performance overheads traditionally associated with the
Function-as-a-Service programming model.
