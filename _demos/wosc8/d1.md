Serverless functions have lately been getting traction in the world of
high-performance applications where the dynamic scheduling features that
serverless cloud environments exhibit can be used to offload CPU-intensive
work to the cloud. This is especially advantageous for workloads where
dynamic parallelism is required. However, using serverless platforms for
this purpose remains difficult in languages like C++ which is traditionally
used for high-performance application. To solve this problem we introduce
cppless, a single-source programming model for high-performance serverless
applications. Cppless allows users to write serverless functions together
with the code that uses them to a low transparent offloading. This allows
us to provide a common abstraction layer for serverless platforms and enables
composable, modular architectures that make use of serverless functions. We
evaluate Cppless using several high-performance problems. The results show
that Cppless provides a low-overhead interface for serverless applications.
